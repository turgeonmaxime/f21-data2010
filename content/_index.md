# General Information

This is the course website for **DATA 2010: Tools and Techniques for Data Science**. This course aims to provide students with an introduction to the field of data science with an emphasis on the fundamental tools and techniques that underlie the field. Throughout the course, students will:

 - Become proficient in `R`/Python, to the level that they can analyze data using the tools from this class.
 - Be able to describe and analyze data through visualization and simple statistical procedures.
 - Be introduced to statistical thinking and be able to think critically about variation and biases.

At the end of the course, students will be able to analyze data using both `R` and Python. Each programming language has its pros and cons, and knowing how to use both is a valuable skill.
