## What is going on?

  - Vaccination and severity are not uniform over age groups.
    + Most unvaccinated people are < 50 years old.
    + Most severe events occur in people who are > 50 years old.
  - When stratifying by age, we see good vaccine efficacy.
  
## Simpson's Paradox

  - **Simpson's Paradox** refers to situations where we see an effect (e.g. vaccine efficacy) in subgroups, but the effect disappears, or attenuates, in aggregate.
  - This paradox can be resolved by careful *interpretation* and *modeling* of the data.
    + In the example above, to accurately model the effect of vaccines, we need to include age in our analysis.
